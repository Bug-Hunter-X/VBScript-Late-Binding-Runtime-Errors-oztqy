This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VBScript programming related to late binding. Late binding, while offering flexibility, can lead to runtime errors that are difficult to track down. The `bug.vbs` file contains code exhibiting the problem, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version with early binding.  The issue is particularly troublesome in larger scripts where the exact cause of a runtime error can be harder to isolate.  Understanding and correctly utilizing early binding is key to writing robust and maintainable VBScript applications.
