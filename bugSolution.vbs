Early Binding: Declare variables explicitly and use early binding to improve code reliability and catch errors earlier in the development cycle.

```vbscript
Dim obj As Object
Set obj = CreateObject("Some.Object")
' Explicit declaration, early binding is used
On Error Resume Next 'Error handling - if needed
result = obj.NonExistentMethod()
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  MsgBox "Error accessing method: " & Err.Description
  Err.Clear
End If
```

This code uses early binding.  While it still might fail at runtime if "Some.Object" isn't available, the compiler will at least be aware of what types you're working with.  The error handling helps gracefully manage any issues that might still occur.
